  Define all your tables and their sizes here.
  All tables must be statically-sized.
  Please don't call malloc () or any of its relatives within your
  program.  The predictor will have a budget, namely (32K + 256) bits
  (not bytes).  That encompasses all storage (all tables, plus GHR, if
  necessary -- but not PC) used for the predictor.  That may not be
  the amount of storage your predictor uses, however -- for example,
  you may implement 2-bit predictors with a table of ints, in which
  case the simulator will use more memory -- that's okay, we're only
  concerned about the memory used by the simulated branch predictor.
