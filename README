****************************************
*   Alteration made to starter code    *
****************************************

1) 3 command line arguments are added to facillitate execution of a 
   given predictor type for certain budget size and branch traces.
   The usage information is as follows.

USAGE: predictor <BUDGET_TYPE> <PRED_TYPE> <path-to-trace-file>
   where,
      BUDGET_TYPE = 1 (for 8K + 64 bits)
                    2 (for 16K + 128 bits)
                    3 (for 32K + 256 bits)
                    4 (for 64K + 512 bits)
                    5 (for 128K + 1K bits)
                    6 (for 1M + 4K bits)
      PRED_TYPE = 1 (for 2-level local predictor)
                  2 (for alpha 21264 -like predictor)
                  3 (for perceptron predictor)
                  4 (for g-share predictor)

2) Makefile has been modified to include newly added per predictor
   header and implementation files in compilation process.

**************************
*    Steps to execute    *
**************************

1) A master scripts has been added to automate the execution of
   all possible predictor runs with different budgets sizes for all
   available traces. This master can be run as follow.

>> ./branch_prediction.sh

2) In order to run individual predictor with specific budget sizes
   and a branch trace, perform below steps.

>> make clean
>> make
>> ./predictor 1 3 ./traces/DIST-INT-1

(Note that above comand runs predictor for budget_type 8K and predictor
 type perceptron predictor and for the brnach trace of integer type.)


Thanks you!
